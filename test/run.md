# JDownload
A socket app which can download web resource from remote web site, currently only http is supported, later ftp support will be added

I have provide a test link to download flashget app.
you have 2 method to run the test.

First.

1. copy shell.sh to src directory.
2. submit shell.sh on linux shell. the shell.sh will compile and run the program to do the download work.
3. just wait on the shell to tell you the download work is completed.

second.

1. copy shell.sh to src directory
2. submit shell.sh as the Frist method above.
3. type ctrl-z to stop the program before download completed.
4. submit shell1.sh, this time, JDownload can parse the breakpoint file, and continue to download the remaiming file.




I also put 3 pic: 1.png 2.png 3.png in test directory. They are the screeshot when I do the second test as described above.
